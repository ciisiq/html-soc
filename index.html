        <h2>What's it all about?</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          School of Code is about opening the opportunity of tech up to
          everyone. Our free coding bootcamp takes you from 0 to programmer and
          launches you into a tech career with our Employer Partners. We've
          achieved 85% employment into tech across all of our bootcamps so far,
          including during the COVID-19 pandemic. We've come a long way since
          our very first bootcamp. We've trained over 200 people, and are
          looking to transform the lives of another 192 across the country
          before April 2022. Take a look back at how it all started with our
          Cohort 1 video.

        <h2>Remote Learning!</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Covid-19 hit us half way through our third bootcamp, and we had to
          immediately learn the ins and outs of learning remotely. We spent the
          time exploring how to do it best, and we are now offering fully remote
          and blended courses. The benefit is that we can help more people than
          before, which helps us achieve our core value of helping more and
          different kinds of people into tech.
